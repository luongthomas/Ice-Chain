# Ice-Chain
Ice Chain is the IoT dApp project aimed to simplify cooperation between operators of the sensitive cargoes. The project offers the all-purpose financial instrument to replace cargo insurance or bank letter of credit and provide the close tie between transportation service quality and effecting payments. 

This should be provided by the interaction between measuring device and Qtum-based smart contract.

## Solving problems
We found out a several points we intend to improve at the market of sensitive cargo logistics.

* Hard to find out who is responsible for the cargo damage.
  *There is no transport insurance for temperature damages of sensitive cargoes
* The company's' working capital gets trapped on accounts of their partners for the time of legal proceedings
  *The processes of financial deals execution are to slow in the field of sensitive cargoes transportation
* Mistrust on the markets which, on top of everything else, makes barriers for SME-companies
  *Small transportation companies can't get access to the market due to lack of reputation despite the possibility to meet customer expectations
  
## Solution
Ice Chain offers the solution based on Qtum smart contract, which is based on traditional LC scheme but also rectifies its common deficiencies.
